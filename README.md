# Food and Pharmaceutical Items Delivery Monitoring Device

### Project Description

This project aims to develop a specialized monitoring device to ensure the safe transportation of food and pharmaceutical items. The device helps maintain optimal temperature conditions, detect vehicle speed, and provide real-time location tracking using GPS. Additionally, it enhances vehicle and driver safety by detecting suspicious activities, monitoring accidents, and preventing unauthorized vehicle usage.

### Features
* Live Location Tracking: GPS-based monitoring to track the vehicle's route.
* Cloud Integration: Sends vehicle data to a cloud platform for remote monitoring.
* Speed Monitoring: Detects and alerts if the vehicle is moving at high speeds.
* Temperature Monitoring: Measures the temperature inside the vehicle and sends alerts if it deviates from the optimal range.
* Accident & Theft Alerts: Sends notifications in case of accidents or theft.
* Driver Behavior Monitoring: Detects unnecessary activities or unauthorized vehicle usage.
* LCD Display: Shows real-time status updates.
